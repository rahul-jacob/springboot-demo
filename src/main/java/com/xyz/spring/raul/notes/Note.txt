Primary bean is where we can have one or more beans of the same type and we want to say just use this bean for all the
 type then mark the bean as primary.We can have several beans of the same type and we can have one of the beans of the
 same type to be marked as @Primary, then the candinates beans whose dependency needs to be injected to them we don't
 need to do any thing special i.e we need not provide the @Qualifier annotation.

In short if we have multiple beans and one of them being the primary and the other's are not then the spring framework 
in automatically inject the bean having the @Primary annotation if you have not mention @Qualifier annotation on the 
candidate bean.
